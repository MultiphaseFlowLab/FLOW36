This handbook is intended to give a general, but very detailed description of the code \texttt{flow36}.\\
The code was initially written in 2017 at TU Wien by \@author, as a replacement for the legacy code \texttt{FLOWSB}, in order to get better overall performance, a more readable and up to date code and improve its scalability.\\
The code performs Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) in a channel geometry, using a pseudo-spectral spatial discretization. The flow solver is coupled with a phase variable solver, which solves the Cahn--Hilliard equation (Phase Field Model).
The code was further developed during the MSCA-ITN-EID project COMETE "Next-Generation Computational Methods for Enhanced Multiphase Flow Processes‚Äù (No 813948) to simulate turbulent three-phase flows and turbulent bubbly-laden flows.
